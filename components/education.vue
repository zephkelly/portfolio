    <p class="info">Ever since I was a child, I have always been fascinated by computers.My dream was to create my own video games, a goal which I have now come to realise after I began my studies of computer programming.</p>
    <p class="info info2">Currently in my second year of studies, I plan to complete my degree by the end of 2025. I aim to use my creative talents and merge them with technical proficiency so that I am able to create stunning applications of all types. I want to work on projects that make an impact in the world and allow me ot challenge myself to overcome new obstacles and grow myself as a developer.</p>
    <p class="info info3">My goal is to use my time as efficiently as I can while studying, making sure I am gaining as much knowledge as I can. I am also pushing myself to work on practical projects on top of my projects in class so that I can apply my new found knowledge and demonstrate my capabilities.</p>
